         <p>
            Hey, I'm Sam. I'm 16, and I’ve always been really into computers and programming. Most of the time, you’ll find me working on some kind of app or project—usually in C# or C++. I’m still learning C++, and yeah, it’s definitely one of the tougher languages out there, but I enjoy the challenge. I live in the U.S., I speak English, and I’ve always loved figuring out how things work, especially when it comes to code. Programming isn’t just something I do for fun—it’s something I want to turn into a career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, I’m in high school and working hard to keep learning more every day. I’m planning to go to Ivy Tech after I graduate to study something related to computer science or software development. I try to stay focused and motivated, even when things get tricky, and I like solving problems in creative ways. Whether it's building tools, writing code, or learning a new language, I’m always trying to improve and do something useful with what I know.
